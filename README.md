# Lift exercise

This exercise was built to analyze if a marketing campaign had a positive lift on sales.

A [notebook](https://github.com/DenisTros/Quilmes_lift/blob/main/notebooks/lift.ipynb) was created for this, as well as a [presentation](https://github.com/DenisTros/Quilmes_lift/blob/main/Quilmes%20Data%20Science%20-%20Denis%20Trosman.pdf) of the findings.
