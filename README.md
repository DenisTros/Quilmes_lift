# Lift exercise

This exercise was built to analyze if a marketing campaign had a positive lift on sales.

A notebook[https://github.com/DenisTros/Quilmes_lift/blob/main/notebooks/lift.ipynb] was created for this, as well as a presentation[https://github.com/DenisTros/Quilmes_lift/blob/main/Quilmes%20Data%20Science%20-%20Denis%20Trosman.pdf] of the findings.
